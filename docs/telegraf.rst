Telegraf metrics ingestion
##########################

Implementing Telegraf and sending its metrics in Splunk is simple, and efficient.

It is not the purpose of this documentation to expose every piece of the installation and configuration of Telegraf or Splunk.

Telegraf installation and configuration
=======================================

Telegraf standard installation (standalone and independant process)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The installation of Telegraf is really straightforward, consult:

- https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf

If you wish to deploy Telegraf as a Splunk TA application instead, consult the next step.

Telegraf deployment as Splunk application deployed by Splunk (TA)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For Linux OS only (this does not work on Windows), you can publish Telegraf through a Splunk application that you push to your clients using a Splunk deployment server.

This means that you can create a custom Technology Addon (TA) that contains both the Telegraf binary and the telegraf.conf configuraton files.

**This method has several advantages:**

- If you are a Splunk customer already, you may have the Splunk Universal Forwarder deployed on your servers, you will NOT need to deploy an additional collector independently from Splunk

- You get benefit from the Splunk centralisation and deploy massively Telegraf from Splunk

- You can maintain and upgrade Telegraf just as you do usually in Splunk, all from your Splunk Deployment Server. (DS)

**If you wish to check for a read to use example, see:**

- https://github.com/guilhemmarchand/TA-telegraf-amd64

**To achieve this, you need to:**

- Create a package in your Splunk Deployment Server, let's call it "TA-telegraf-linux-amd64", if you have more than this architecture to maintain, just reproduce the same steps for other processor architectures. (arm, etc)

::

    $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-server/TA-telegraf-linux-amd64
                                                        /bin
                                                        /local/telegraf.conf
                                                        /metadata/default.meta

- The "bin" directory hosts the Telegraf binary

- The "local" directory hosts the telegraf.conf configuration file

- The "metadata" directory is a standard directory that should contain a default.meta which in the context of the TA will contain:

*default.meta*

::

    # Application-level permissions
    []
    owner = admin
    access = read : [ * ], write : [ admin ]
    export = system

- Download the last Telegraf version for your processor architecture (here amd64), and extract its contain in the "bin" directory, you will get:

::

    bin/telegraf/etc
    bin/telegraf/usr
    bin/telegraf/var

- Telegraf provides an "init.sh" script that we will use to manage the state of the Telegraf process:

::

    bin/telegraf/usr/lib/telegraf/scripts/init.sh

- Copy this "init.sh" script to the root of the "bin" directory:

::

    cp -p bin/telegraf/usr/lib/telegraf/scripts/init.sh bin/

- Achieve some minor modifications related to patch customizations, basically:

Change:

::

    USER=telegraf
    GROUP=telegraf

By:

::

    USER=$(whoami)
    GROUP=$(id -g -n)

*Notes: the configuration above will automatically use the owner of the Splunk processes*

Change:

::

    daemon=/usr/bin/telegraf

By:

::

    daemon=$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-telegraf-amd64/bin/telegraf/usr/bin/telegraf

Change:

::

    config=/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
    confdir=/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d

By:

::

    config=$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-telegraf-amd64/local/telegraf.conf
    confdir=$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-telegraf-amd64/bin/telegraf/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d


**Finally, create a very simple local/inputs.conf configuration file:**

*local/inputs.conf*

::

    # start telegraf at Splunk start, and restart if Splunk is restarted. (which allows upgrading easily Telegraf binaries shipped with the TA package)
    [script://./bin/init.sh restart]
    disabled = false
    interval = -1

Et voila ! Deploy this TA to your Linux host and start receiving metrics in Splunk.

If you wish to check for a read to use example, see:

- https://github.com/guilhemmarchand/TA-telegraf-amd64

**Upgrades:**

To upgrade Telegraf binary to a new version, simply extract the new tgz release in the "bin" directory, and reload your Splunk Deployment server.

Splunk will automatically restart the Telegraf process after Splunk startup.

Telegraf minimal configuration
------------------------------

A minimal configuration to monitor Operating System metrics:

- https://docs.influxdata.com/chronograf/latest/guides/using-precreated-dashboards/#system

The output configuration depends on the deployment you choose to use to ingest metrics in Splunk, consult the next sections.

**Example of a minimal telegraf.conf configuration that monitors Operating System metrics for Linux**::

    # Read metrics about cpu usage
    [[inputs.cpu]]
      ## Whether to report per-cpu stats or not
      percpu = true
      ## Whether to report total system cpu stats or not
      totalcpu = true
      ## If true, collect raw CPU time metrics.
      collect_cpu_time = false
      ## If true, compute and report the sum of all non-idle CPU states.
      report_active = false

    # Read metrics about disk usage by mount point
    [[inputs.disk]]
      ## By default stats will be gathered for all mount points.
      ## Set mount_points will restrict the stats to only the specified mount points.
      # mount_points = ["/"]

      ## Ignore mount points by filesystem type.
      ignore_fs = ["tmpfs", "devtmpfs", "devfs"]

    # Read metrics about disk IO by device
    [[inputs.diskio]]
      ## By default, telegraf will gather stats for all devices including
      ## disk partitions.
      ## Setting devices will restrict the stats to the specified devices.
      # devices = ["sda", "sdb", "vd*"]
      ## Uncomment the following line if you need disk serial numbers.
      # skip_serial_number = false
      #
      ## On systems which support it, device metadata can be added in the form of
      ## tags.
      ## Currently only Linux is supported via udev properties. You can view
      ## available properties for a device by running:
      ## 'udevadm info -q property -n /dev/sda'
      # device_tags = ["ID_FS_TYPE", "ID_FS_USAGE"]
      #
      ## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the
      ## name of the device via templates.
      ## The 'name_templates' parameter is a list of templates to try and apply to
      ## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
      ## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not
      ## present for the device is used as the device name tag.
      ## The typical use case is for LVM volumes, to get the VG/LV name instead of
      ## the near-meaningless DM-0 name.
      # name_templates = ["$ID_FS_LABEL","$DM_VG_NAME/$DM_LV_NAME"]

    # Get kernel statistics from /proc/stat
    [[inputs.kernel]]
      # no configuration


    # Read metrics about memory usage
    [[inputs.mem]]
      # no configuration


    # Get the number of processes and group them by status
    [[inputs.processes]]
      # no configuration


    # Read metrics about swap memory usage
    [[inputs.swap]]
      # no configuration


    # Read metrics about system load & uptime
    [[inputs.system]]
      # no configuration

    # # Read metrics about network interface usage
    [[inputs.net]]
    #   ## By default, telegraf gathers stats from any up interface (excluding loopback)
    #   ## Setting interfaces will tell it to gather these explicit interfaces,
    #   ## regardless of status.
    #   ##
    #   # interfaces = ["eth0"]
    #   ##
    #   ## On linux systems telegraf also collects protocol stats.
    #   ## Setting ignore_protocol_stats to true will skip reporting of protocol metrics.
    #   ##
    #   # ignore_protocol_stats = false
    #   ##

    # # Read TCP metrics such as established, time wait and sockets counts.
    [[inputs.netstat]]
    #   # no configuration

    # # Monitor process cpu and memory usage
    [[inputs.procstat]]
    #   ## PID file to monitor process
    #   pid_file = "/var/run/nginx.pid"
    #   ## executable name (ie, pgrep <exe>)
    #   # exe = "nginx"
    #   ## pattern as argument for pgrep (ie, pgrep -f <pattern>)
    #   # pattern = "nginx"
    #   ## user as argument for pgrep (ie, pgrep -u <user>)
        user = "guilhem"
    #   ## Systemd unit name
    #   # systemd_unit = "nginx.service"
    #   ## CGroup name or path
    #   # cgroup = "systemd/system.slice/nginx.service"
    #
    #   ## override for process_name
    #   ## This is optional; default is sourced from /proc/<pid>/status
    #   # process_name = "bar"
    #
    #   ## Field name prefix
    #   # prefix = ""
    #
    #   ## Add PID as a tag instead of a field; useful to differentiate between
    #   ## processes whose tags are otherwise the same.  Can create a large number
    #   ## of series, use judiciously.
    #   # pid_tag = false
    #
    #   ## Method to use when finding process IDs.  Can be one of 'pgrep', or
    #   ## 'native'.  The pgrep finder calls the pgrep executable in the PATH while
    #   ## the native finder performs the search directly in a manor dependent on the
    #   ## platform.  Default is 'pgrep'
    #   # pid_finder = "pgrep"



Windows additional configuration (mem inputs)
---------------------------------------------

For Windows memory management, the default win_mem inputs does not retrieve some of the metrics we need.

You need to activate the memory inputs. (which on Windows uses WMI collection)::

    [[inputs.mem]]
    # no configuration

Windows Active Directory Domain Controller
------------------------------------------

**Follow instructions for "Active Directory Domain Controller":**

- https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/win_perf_counters#active-directory-domain-controller

Windows DNS server
------------------

**Follow instructions for "DNS Server + Domain Controllers":**

- https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/win_perf_counters#dns-server--domain-controllers

Windows DFS server
------------------

**For DFS Namespace, follow instructions for "DFS Namespace + Domain Controllers":**

- https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/win_perf_counters#dfs-namespace--domain-controllers

**For DFS Replication, follow instructions for "DFS Replication + Domain Controllers":**

- https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/win_perf_counters#dfs-replication--domain-controllers

Microsoft IIS / ASP.NET
-----------------------

**For IIS and ASP.NET, follow instructions for: IIS / ASP.NET**

- https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/win_perf_counters#iis--aspnet

Linux processes monitoring (procstat)
-------------------------------------

In the linux views, the processes usage (both CPU and Memory) rely on the procstat inputs, which requires additional configuration depending on your context.

As for an example, the following configuration monitors all the processes owned by the "splunk" unix user::

    [[inputs.procstat]]
    #   ## PID file to monitor process
    #   pid_file = "/var/run/nginx.pid"
    #   ## executable name (ie, pgrep <exe>)
    #   # exe = "nginx"
    #   ## pattern as argument for pgrep (ie, pgrep -f <pattern>)
    #   # pattern = "nginx"
    #   ## user as argument for pgrep (ie, pgrep -u <user>)
        user = "splunk"

HTTP Events Collector (HEC)
===========================

**Splunk deployment with HEC (available with Telegraf starting version 1.8)**


*Telegraf agents --> HTTP over SSL --> Splunk HEC inputs*

With Telegraf starting version 1.8, you can send metrics directly from Telegraf to HTTP Events Collector using the
excellent serializer leveraging the http Telegraf output.

This is extremely simple, scalable and reliable.

*Example of an HEC input definition:*

**Splunk inputs.conf**::

    [http://Telegraf]
    disabled = 0
    index = telegraf
    indexes = telegraf
    token = c386d4c8-8b50-4178-be76-508dca2f19e2


**Telegraf configuration:**

The Telegraf configuration is really simple and relies on defining your ouput:

*Example*::

    [[outputs.http]]
       ## URL is the address to send metrics to
       url = "https://mysplunk.domain.com:8088/services/collector"
        ## Timeout for HTTP message
       # timeout = "5s"
        ## Optional TLS Config
       # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
       # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
       # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
       ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
       insecure_skip_verify = true
        ## Data format to output.
       ## Each data format has it's own unique set of configuration options, read
       ## more about them here:
       ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_OUTPUT.md
       data_format = "splunkmetric"
        ## Provides time, index, source overrides for the HEC
       splunkmetric_hec_routing = true
        ## Additional HTTP headers
        [outputs.http.headers]
       # Should be set manually to "application/json" for json data_format
          Content-Type = "application/json"
          Authorization = "Splunk c386d4c8-8b50-4178-be76-508dca2f19e2"
          X-Splunk-Request-Channel = "c386d4c8-8b50-4178-be76-508dca2f19e2"


Push this configuration to your Telegraf agents, et voila.

**Check data availability in Splunk**::

    | mcatalog values(_dims) as dimensions values(metric_name) as metric_name where index=telegraf metric_name=*


TCP / TCP-SSL Inputs
====================

**Splunk deployment with TCP inputs.**

**This deployment requires additional indexing time parsing configuration:**

- https://github.com/guilhemmarchand/TA-influxdata-telegraf

The deployment is very simple and can be described as:

*Telegraf agents --> TCP or TCP over SSL --> Splunk TCP inputs*

In addition and to provide resiliency, it is fairly simple to add a load balancer in front of Splunk, such that you service continues to ingest metrics depending on
Splunk components availability. (HAProxy, Nginx, F5, whatsoever...)

The data output format used by Telegraf agents is the "Graphite" format with tag support enable.
This is simple, beautiful, accurate and allows the management of any number of dimensions.

*Example of a tcp input definition:*

**Splunk inputs.conf**::

    [tcp://2003]
    connection_host = dns
    index = telegraf
    sourcetype = tcp:telegraf:graphite


**Telegraf configuration:**

The Telegraf configuration is really simple and relies on defining your ouput:

Example::

    [[outputs.graphite]]
      ## TCP endpoint for your graphite instance.
      ## If multiple endpoints are configured, the output will be load balanced.
      ## Only one of the endpoints will be written to with each iteration.
      servers = ["mysplunk.domain.com:2003"]
      ## Prefix metrics name
      prefix = ""
      ## Graphite output template
      ## see https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_OUTPUT.md
      # template = "host.tags.measurement.field"

      ## Enable Graphite tags support
      graphite_tag_support = true

      ## timeout in seconds for the write connection to graphite
      timeout = 2

Push this configuration to your Telegraf agents, et voila.

**Check data availability in Splunk::**

    | mcatalog values(_dims) as dimensions values(metric_name) as metric_name where index=telegraf metric_name=*

SPLUNK file monitoring Ingestion
================================

**Splunk deployment with Splunk file monitoring.**

**This deployment requires additional indexing time parsing configuration:**

- https://github.com/guilhemmarchand/TA-influxdata-telegraf

Telegraf has a "file" output plugin that allows writing metrics to a local file on the file-system, don't say more that is much more than enough
to Splunk it.

**The Telegraf configuration is really simple and relies on defining your ouput:**

Example::

    [[outputs.file]]
      ## Files to write to, "stdout" is a specially handled file.
      files = ["/tmp/metrics.out"]

      ## Data format to output.
      ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
      ## more about them here:
      ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_OUTPUT.md
      data_format = "graphite"
      graphite_tag_support = true

Notes: this is a simplistic example, in real condition do not forget to manage the file rotation using a simple logrorate configuration for Linux, and relevant solution for other OS.

**Splunk file input configuration:**

I cannot say more, this is simple, very simple. Add the following configuration to any inputs.conf configuration file of your choice:

Example::

    [monitor::/tmp/metrics.out]
    disabled = false
    index = telegraf
    sourcetype = file:telegraf:graphite

Apply this simple input.conf, if you deploy thought the Splunk deployment server ensure splunkd is configured to restart in your serverclass configuration.

Et voila, Splunk ingests the metrics continously and metrics are forwarded to the indexing layer using your Splunk infrastructure, be on-premise, private or Splunk Cloud.


KAFKA Ingestion
===============

**Splunk deployment with Kafka.**

**This deployment requires additional indexing time parsing configuration:**

- https://github.com/guilhemmarchand/TA-influxdata-telegraf

If you are using Kafka, or consider using it, producing Telegraf metrics to Kafka makes a lot of sense.

First, Telegraf has a native output plugin that produces to a Kafka topic, Telegraf will send the metrics directly to one or more
Kafka brokers providing scaling and resiliency.

Then, Splunk becomes one consumer of the metrics using the scalable and resilient Kafka connect infrastructure and the Splunk Kafka connect sink connector.
By using Kafka as the mainstream for your metrics, you preserve the possibility of having multiple technologies consuming these data in addition with Splunk, while
implementing a massively scalable and resilient environment.

On the final step that streams data to Splunk, the Kafka sink connector for Splunk sends data to Splunk HEC, which makes it resilient, scalable and eligible to all
Splunk on-premise or Splunk Cloud platforms easily.

**The deployment with Kafka can be described the following way:**

*Telegraf agents --> Kafka brokers <-- Kafka connect running Splunk sink connector --> Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC)*

**Configuring Kafka connect:**

- The Kafka connect properties needs to use the "String" converter, the following example start Kafka connect with the relevant configuration:

*connect-distributed.properties*::

    # These are defaults. This file just demonstrates how to override some settings.
    bootstrap.servers=kafka-1:9092,kafka-2:9092,kafka-3:9092
    key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    key.converter.schemas.enable=false
    value.converter.schemas.enable=false
    internal.key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
    internal.value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
    internal.key.converter.schemas.enable=false
    internal.value.converter.schemas.enable=false
    # Flush much faster (10s) than normal, which is useful for testing/debugging
    offset.flush.interval.ms=10000
    plugin.path=/etc/kafka-connect/jars
    group.id=kafka-connect-splunk-hec-sink
    config.storage.topic=__kafka-connect-splunk-task-configs
    config.storage.replication.factor=3
    offset.storage.topic=__kafka-connect-splunk-offsets
    offset.storage.replication.factor=3
    offset.storage.partitions=25
    status.storage.topic=__kafka-connect-splunk-statuses
    status.storage.replication.factor=3
    status.storage.partitions=5
    # These are provided to inform the user about the presence of the REST host and port configs
    # Hostname & Port for the REST API to listen on. If this is set, it will bind to the interface used to listen to requests.
    #rest.host.name=
    rest.port=8082
    # The Hostname & Port that will be given out to other workers to connect to i.e. URLs that are routable from other servers.
    # rest.advertised.host.name=kafka-connect-1

**Apply the following command against Kafka connect running the Splunk Kafka sink connector:** (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3862)

- replace <ip address or host> by the IP address or the host name of the Kafla connect node, if you run the command locally, simply use localhost
- replace the port if required (default is 8082)
- replace the HEC token
- replace the HEC destination
- adapt any other configuration item up to your needs

**Achieve the following command**::

    curl localhost:8082/connectors -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "name": "kafka-connect-telegraf",
    "config": {
    "connector.class": "com.splunk.kafka.connect.SplunkSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "3",
    "topics":"telegraf",
    "splunk.indexes": "telegraf",
    "splunk.sourcetypes": "kafka:telegraf:graphite",
    "splunk.hec.uri": "https://myhecinput.splunk.com:8088",
    "splunk.hec.token": "fd96ffb6-fb3e-43aa-9e8b-de911356443f",
    "splunk.hec.raw": "true",
    "splunk.hec.ack.enabled": "true",
    "splunk.hec.ack.poll.interval": "10",
    "splunk.hec.ack.poll.threads": "2",
    "splunk.hec.ssl.validate.certs": "false",
    "splunk.hec.http.keepalive": "true",
    "splunk.hec.max.http.connection.per.channel": "4",
    "splunk.hec.total.channels": "8",
    "splunk.hec.max.batch.size": "1000000",
    "splunk.hec.threads": "2",
    "splunk.hec.event.timeout": "300",
    "splunk.hec.socket.timeout": "120",
    "splunk.hec.track.data": "true"
    }
    }'

**telegraf output configuration:**

Configure your Telegraf agents to send data directly to the Kafka broker in graphite format with tag support::

    [[outputs.kafka]]
      ## URLs of kafka brokers
      brokers = ["kafka-1:19092","kafka-2:29092","kafka-3:39092"]
      ## Kafka topic for producer messages
      topic = "telegraf"
      data_format = "graphite"
      graphite_tag_support = true

Et voila. Congratulations, you have built a massively scalable, distributable, open and resilient metric collection infrastructure.

**Check data availability in Splunk**::

    | mcatalog values(_dims) as dimensions values(metric_name) as metric_name where index=telegraf metric_name=*
